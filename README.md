# MindEmpathy
The MindEmpathy collaborative crowdsourcing platform was built in occasion of the 2020 Codemotion [Hack and Secure the Workplace!](https://events.codemotion.com/hackathons/cloud-native-solutions-for-a-low-touch-economy-scenario/home) by team MindEmpathy as a Cloud Native Solution for a Low-Touch Economy Scenario.

## Demo
The platform can be explored at mindempathy.net

## Installation
This is a WordPress theme with templates. You should add pages and assign the appropriate templates to them and install some plugins for particular functionalities of the website. We don't have time to talk about it in detail. 
## Usage
Once the platform is live you can start building a collaborative crowdsourcing network. 
Enjoy and stay well!
